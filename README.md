## Installation & Setup ‚ö°

Follow these steps to set up the app locally:

### 1. Clone the repository:
Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-management-app.git
cd school-management-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
#### Backend (Node.js & Express):
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Frontend (React.js):
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure PostgreSQL Database

If you're running a **local PostgreSQL** instance, make sure to:

1. Create a new database in **pgAdmin** (or use the PostgreSQL shell).
2. If you're using **Heroku Postgres**, skip this step and get the database connection URL directly from Heroku.

### 4. Update your environment variables:
- Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory and add your database connection settings:
  ```env
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_PORT=5432
  DB_USER=your_username
  DB_PASSWORD=your_password
  DB_NAME=your_database_name
  ```

- Optionally, create a `.env` file in the **frontend** directory and set the API URL:
  ```env
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
  ```

### 5. Run the app locally:
#### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

#### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Your app will be live at:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)

### 6. PostgreSQL Setup (Optional)

To set up the PostgreSQL database locally, use **pgAdmin** or the PostgreSQL shell to create the following table schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE schools (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    contact_email VARCHAR(255),
    website_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### 7. Seeding Your Database

You can manually add data to your PostgreSQL database via **pgAdmin**, or seed it using a script to populate the schools table.


  ```

## Usage üìò

1. **Homepage**: View a list of all schools.
2. **School Details**: Click on any school to view detailed information.
3. **Add School**: Click the "Add School" button to add a new school to the database.
4. **Pagination**: Navigate through pages of school listings.
5. **Search**: Use the search bar to find schools quickly.
